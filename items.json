Its purpose is to help everyone realize their potential and have respective impact in life. To this end, the \u201cLife Impact Series\u201d will offer workshops and tutorials to improve non-technical skills and develop one\u2019s career, e.g., by focusing on topics such as self-management, leadership, personality etc. The first event now focused on the topic of creating socio-economic impact as an entrepreneur: what it\u2019s like to found a company, what it takes to be an entrepreneur, and where to find support.</p>\n<p>The first presentation was given by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mauricegonzenbach/?originalSubdomain=ch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Maurice Gonzenbach</a>, co-founder and machine learning engineer at <a href=\"https://caplena.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Caplena</a>, a Swiss company for AI-powered user feedback analysis. The company was founded almost 5 years ago and is now successfully established in the market, with large and important customers worldwide. Maurice gave valuable insights into his personal lessons learned and what to focus on when joining the endeavor of an own company.</p>\n<p>The second speaker was <a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/rosn/\" target=\"_blank\">Matthias Rosenthal</a>, co-founder and former CTO of sonic emotion ag and now one of the leaders behind the entrepreneurship initiative at the ZHAW School of Engineering. He explained the roadmap of the initiative and how it is embedded into the existing landscape of funding and supportive instruments for young entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>The Life Impact Series will continue with a roughly quarterly schedule. \u00a0Specific events might be open also to external participants. The next event will take place on July 05 (later afternoon / evening) and shed light on the topic of personality types and their impact on one\u2019s work and life.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    \n                    <p class=\"browserBackLink\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"backInContext();return false;\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>go back</a></p>\n                \n        </div>"]},

From the neurobiological and psychological point of view, he argued that top-down influences, such as goals, beliefs, and aspirations are combined with bottom-up influences, such as individual genetics and conscious experiences to build up the decision-making process.</p>\n<p>More specifically, he pointed out that most of our decisions are a combination of biological drives and beliefs together with conscious and subconscious experiences.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Prof. Newsome argued that the knowledge of neurons and synapses is essential for understanding how the brain shapes cognition.\u00a0 But systems-level knowledge, including the level of the unique person, is essential to understand how and why specific behaviors emerge from the interactions of billions of neurons. This multilevel perspective allows us then to think about the relationship about human choice and freedom with the ultimate goal of enhancing human growth and health.</p>\n<p>Finally, Prof. Newsome pointed out that having defined moral principles and recognizing situational risk factors, can help us to be the people we most want to be.</p>\n<p>* <a href=\"https://www.templeton.org/about/vision-mission-impact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The John Templeton Foundation</a> funds research and catalyzes conversations that inspire people with awe and wonder focusing on world affairs and religion.

That is the goal of the interdisciplinary panels \"Pathways beyond Present AI\", organised by the <a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/cai/\" target=\"_blank\">ZHAW Center for Artificial Intelligence</a> (CAI).</p>\n<p>The first one of these panels took place within the frame of the <a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/cai/colloquium/\" target=\"_blank\">CAI colloquia</a> on April 27th. It focused on recent insights into the way the structure of self-organised neural circuits acts as bias tuning the brain to the natural environment.</p>\n<p>The event started by a brief on this topic by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoph_von_der_Malsburg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Prof. Dr. Christoph von der Malsburg </a>(Senior Fellow at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies, and guest professor at UZH/ETH and ZHAW). His hypothesis, developed together with <a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/de/ueber-uns/person/stdm/\" target=\"_blank\">Prof Dr. Thilo Stadelmann</a> (ZHAW CAI) and <a href=\"https://services.ini.uzh.ch/people/bgrewe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Prof Dr. Benjamin Grewe</a> (UZH/ETHZ) in this <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00002\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">paper</a>, states that the structures of brain and natural environment are closely related.\u00a0In particular, the structural regularity of the brain takes the form of net fragments (self-organised network patterns) and that these serve as the powerful inductive bias that enables the brain to learn quickly, generalise from few examples and bridge the gap between abstractly defined general goals and concrete situations.\u00a0Preliminary studies on computer vision applications provide supporting evidence to this hypothesis.</p>\n<p>The presentation was followed by a panel where Profs. von Der Malsburg, Stadelmann, and Grewe were joined by experts from various fields spanning technology and biology. The present panelists were <a href=\"https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en/institute/people?uname=cook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Dr. Matthew Cook</a> (UZH/ETHZ, Neuroinformatics, Cortical Computation), <a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/furu/\" target=\"_blank\">Prof. Dr. Rudolf Marcel F\u00fcchslin</a> (ZHAW, School of Engineering, Applied Complex Systems Science), <a href=\"https://www.psychology.uzh.ch/en/areas/dev/geronto/team/mmartin.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Prof. Dr. Mike Martin</a> (UZH, Gerontopsychology), <a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/ottt/\" target=\"_blank\">Prof. Dr. Thomas Ott</a> (ZHAW, ZHAW School of Life Sciences and Facility Management, Computational Life Sciences). <a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/klam/\" target=\"_blank\">Prof. Dr. Verena Klamroth-Marganska</a> (ZHAW, School of Health, Occupational Therapy), was also invited as panelists but could not attend due to a last minute contingency.\u00a0 The panel was moderated by ZHAW\u2019s <a href=\"https://rchavarriaga.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Dr. Ricardo Chavarriaga</a>, head of the CLAIRE office Switzerland.</p>\n<p>The panel covered multiple topics, starting from the fundamental question of what is intelligence. Besides the ability of generalisation mentioned above, panelists mentioned the capacity defining (self-generated) goals as one of the main signs of intelligent. This is complemented by common-sense -achieving semantic meaning of things-and intentionality (that goes beyond simple activities and behaviours) which were all considered as particular characteristics of intelligence that AI has not yet fully achieved.</p>\n<p>Another important feature that was mentioned is the ability to establish connections between concrete scenes and these abstract goals, which enable e.g. intentionality. Additionally, the possibility of taking a very complex idea and transform it into a concrete stimulus (e.g. a picture) is an important element for intelligence. This process can be interpreted as inverse problem to processes characterised in the opening lecture. last but not least, it was mentioned that the fact that intelligence develops within a cultural environment should not be neglected.</p>\n<p>While addressing which directions AI development should go, the discussion ensued addressing the need for having system that learns while embedded and interacting in an environment, as well as the need of asking the question of what would we like to use the AI for; e.g., Some applications may not require human-like intelligence to be efficiently solved, while others we may prefer to be solved by humans instead of machines. Interestingly, it was pointed out that increase in computing power may be hindering our possibility of creating artificial intelligence as we lose capacity to learn from small datasets.</p>\n<p>Interaction between panelists and audience delve into different aspects of learning and the role of collective intelligence in the advancement of this field. As well, as the possibility of identifying universal learning rules that, combined with specialised brain-like structures and architectures, can lead us closer to understanding intelligence and more powerful AI. We will continue exploring these topics in future panels in this series and in the <a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/cai/colloquium/\" target=\"_blank\">CAI Colloquium</a>.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    \n                    <p class=\"browserBackLink\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"backInContext();return false;\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>go back</a></p>\n                \n        </div>"]},

All these areas utilize deep learning, a methodology that optimizes complex machine learning systems with enormous compute power and many examples in the form of large data sets. For these computationally intensive optimization problems, graphics processing units (GPUs) are typically used because they can process many calculations in parallel. In addition to GPUs, CPUs are needed to load the data from the file system, as well as memory (RAM) to temporarily store the large amounts of data on the system.</p>\n<p>For this purpose, the CAI, together with the <a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/init/\" target=\"_blank\">InIT</a>, maintains a state-of-the-art infrastructure that is constantly being renewed and optimized. Currently, staff researchers have access to several systems with a total of 124 GPUs, 2648 CPU cores and 21.5 TB of RAM. After a massive increase in compute power in recent years, the storage system has now been renewed. This improves the management of deep learning training data sets that typically consist of millions of tiny files such as text snippets, images or short video sequences. To this end, a new storage system from <a href=\"https://www.dalco.ch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">DALCO</a> that offers 216 TB HDD and 15 TB SSD storage replaces the existing system. The new storage server is connected to the compute cluster with two redundant 100 GB network connections and thus allows lightning-fast data access.</p>\n<p>With this new storage server, the CAI is equipped to train deep learning models even more efficiently and thus accelerates research and industrial applications.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n                    </div>\n                    \n                    <p class=\"browserBackLink\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"backInContext();return false;\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>go back</a></p>\n                \n        </div>"]},

Its purpose is to help everyone realize their potential and have respective impact in life. To this end, the \u201cLife Impact Series\u201d will offer workshops and tutorials to improve non-technical skills and develop one\u2019s career, e.g., by focusing on topics such as self-management, leadership, personality etc. The first event now focused on the topic of creating socio-economic impact as an entrepreneur: what it\u2019s like to found a company, what it takes to be an entrepreneur, and where to find support.</p>\n<p>The first presentation was given by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mauricegonzenbach/?originalSubdomain=ch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Maurice Gonzenbach</a>, co-founder and machine learning engineer at <a href=\"https://caplena.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Caplena</a>, a Swiss company for AI-powered user feedback analysis. The company was founded almost 5 years ago and is now successfully established in the market, with large and important customers worldwide. Maurice gave valuable insights into his personal lessons learned and what to focus on when joining the endeavor of an own company.</p>\n<p>The second speaker was <a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/rosn/\" target=\"_blank\">Matthias Rosenthal</a>, co-founder and former CTO of sonic emotion ag and now one of the leaders behind the entrepreneurship initiative at the ZHAW School of Engineering.

From the neurobiological and psychological point of view, he argued that top-down influences, such as goals, beliefs, and aspirations are combined with bottom-up influences, such as individual genetics and conscious experiences to build up the decision-making process.</p>\n<p>More specifically, he pointed out that most of our decisions are a combination of biological drives and beliefs together with conscious and subconscious experiences.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Prof. Newsome argued that the knowledge of neurons and synapses is essential for understanding how the brain shapes cognition.\u00a0 But systems-level knowledge, including the level of the unique person, is essential to understand how and why specific behaviors emerge from the interactions of billions of neurons. This multilevel perspective allows us then to think about the relationship about human choice and freedom with the ultimate goal of enhancing human growth and health.</p>\n<p>Finally, Prof. Newsome pointed out that having defined moral principles and recognizing situational risk factors, can help us to be the people we most want to be.</p>\n<p>* <a href=\"https://www.templeton.org/about/vision-mission-impact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The John Templeton Foundation</a> funds research and catalyzes conversations that inspire people with awe and wonder focusing on world affairs and religion.

That is the goal of the interdisciplinary panels \"Pathways beyond Present AI\", organised by the <a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/cai/\" target=\"_blank\">ZHAW Center for Artificial Intelligence</a> (CAI).</p>\n<p>The first one of these panels took place within the frame of the <a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/cai/colloquium/\" target=\"_blank\">CAI colloquia</a> on April 27th. It focused on recent insights into the way the structure of self-organised neural circuits acts as bias tuning the brain to the natural environment.</p>\n<p>The event started by a brief on this topic by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoph_von_der_Malsburg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Prof. Dr. Christoph von der Malsburg </a>(Senior Fellow at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies, and guest professor at UZH/ETH and ZHAW). His hypothesis, developed together with <a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/de/ueber-uns/person/stdm/\" target=\"_blank\">Prof Dr. Thilo Stadelmann</a> (ZHAW CAI) and <a href=\"https://services.ini.uzh.ch/people/bgrewe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Prof Dr. Benjamin Grewe</a> (UZH/ETHZ) in this <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00002\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">paper</a>, states that the structures of brain and natural environment are closely related.\u00a0In particular, the structural regularity of the brain takes the form of net fragments (self-organised network patterns) and that these serve as the powerful inductive bias that enables the brain to learn quickly, generalise from few examples and bridge the gap between abstractly defined general goals and concrete situations.\u00a0Preliminary studies on computer vision applications provide supporting evidence to this hypothesis.</p>\n<p>The presentation was followed by a panel where Profs. von Der Malsburg, Stadelmann, and Grewe were joined by experts from various fields spanning technology and biology. The present panelists were <a href=\"https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en/institute/people?uname=cook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Dr. Matthew Cook</a> (UZH/ETHZ, Neuroinformatics, Cortical Computation), <a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/furu/\" target=\"_blank\">Prof. Dr. Rudolf Marcel F\u00fcchslin</a> (ZHAW, School of Engineering, Applied Complex Systems Science), <a href=\"https://www.psychology.uzh.ch/en/areas/dev/geronto/team/mmartin.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Prof. Dr. Mike Martin</a> (UZH, Gerontopsychology), <a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/ottt/\" target=\"_blank\">Prof. Dr. Thomas Ott</a> (ZHAW, ZHAW School of Life Sciences and Facility Management, Computational Life Sciences). <a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/klam/\" target=\"_blank\">Prof. Dr. Verena Klamroth-Marganska</a> (ZHAW, School of Health, Occupational Therapy), was also invited as panelists but could not attend due to a last minute contingency.\u00a0 The panel was moderated by ZHAW\u2019s <a href=\"https://rchavarriaga.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Dr. Ricardo Chavarriaga</a>, head of the CLAIRE office Switzerland.</p>\n<p>The panel covered multiple topics, starting from the fundamental question of what is intelligence. Besides the ability of generalisation mentioned above, panelists mentioned the capacity defining (self-generated) goals as one of the main signs of intelligent. This is complemented by common-sense -achieving semantic meaning of things-and intentionality (that goes beyond simple activities and behaviours) which were all considered as particular characteristics of intelligence that AI has not yet fully achieved.</p>\n<p>Another important feature that was mentioned is the ability to establish connections between concrete scenes and these abstract goals, which enable e.g. intentionality. Additionally, the possibility of taking a very complex idea and transform it into a concrete stimulus (e.g. a picture) is an important element for intelligence. This process can be interpreted as inverse problem to processes characterised in the opening lecture. last but not least, it was mentioned that the fact that intelligence develops within a cultural environment should not be neglected.</p>\n<p>While addressing which directions AI development should go, the discussion ensued addressing the need for having system that learns while embedded and interacting in an environment, as well as the need of asking the question of what would we like to use the AI for; e.g., Some applications may not require human-like intelligence to be efficiently solved, while others we may prefer to be solved by humans instead of machines. Interestingly, it was pointed out that increase in computing power may be hindering our possibility of creating artificial intelligence as we lose capacity to learn from small datasets.</p>\n<p>Interaction between panelists and audience delve into different aspects of learning and the role of collective intelligence in the advancement of this field. As well, as the possibility of identifying universal learning rules that, combined with specialised brain-like structures and architectures, can lead us closer to understanding intelligence and more powerful AI. We will continue exploring these topics in future panels in this series and in the <a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/cai/colloquium/\" target=\"_blank\">CAI Colloquium</a>.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    \n                    <p class=\"browserBackLink\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"backInContext();return false;\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>go back</a></p>\n                \n        </div>"]},

All these areas utilize deep learning, a methodology that optimizes complex machine learning systems with enormous compute power and many examples in the form of large data sets. For these computationally intensive optimization problems, graphics processing units (GPUs) are typically used because they can process many calculations in parallel. In addition to GPUs, CPUs are needed to load the data from the file system, as well as memory (RAM) to temporarily store the large amounts of data on the system.</p>\n<p>For this purpose, the CAI, together with the <a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/init/\" target=\"_blank\">InIT</a>, maintains a state-of-the-art infrastructure that is constantly being renewed and optimized. Currently, staff researchers have access to several systems with a total of 124 GPUs, 2648 CPU cores and 21.5 TB of RAM. After a massive increase in compute power in recent years, the storage system has now been renewed. This improves the management of deep learning training data sets that typically consist of millions of tiny files such as text snippets, images or short video sequences. To this end, a new storage system from <a href=\"https://www.dalco.ch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">DALCO</a> that offers 216 TB HDD and 15 TB SSD storage replaces the existing system. The new storage server is connected to the compute cluster with two redundant 100 GB network connections and thus allows lightning-fast data access.</p>\n<p>With this new storage server, the CAI is equipped to train deep learning models even more efficiently and thus accelerates research and industrial applications.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n                    </div>\n                    \n                    <p class=\"browserBackLink\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"backInContext();return false;\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>go back</a></p>\n                \n        </div>"]},

His hypothesis, developed together with <a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/de/ueber-uns/person/stdm/\" target=\"_blank\">Prof Dr. Thilo Stadelmann</a> (ZHAW CAI) and <a href=\"https://services.ini.uzh.ch/people/bgrewe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Prof Dr. Benjamin Grewe</a> (UZH/ETHZ) in this <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00002\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">paper</a>, states that the structures of brain and natural environment are closely related.\u00a0In particular, the structural regularity of the brain takes the form of net fragments (self-organised network patterns) and that these serve as the powerful inductive bias that enables the brain to learn quickly, generalise from few examples and bridge the gap between abstractly defined general goals and concrete situations.\u00a0Preliminary studies on computer vision applications provide supporting evidence to this hypothesis.</p>", "<p>The presentation was followed by a panel where Profs. von Der Malsburg, Stadelmann, and Grewe were joined by experts from various fields spanning technology and biology. The present panelists were <a href=\"https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en/institute/people?uname=cook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Dr. Matthew Cook</a> (UZH/ETHZ, Neuroinformatics, Cortical Computation), <a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/furu/\" target=\"_blank\">Prof. Dr. Rudolf Marcel F\u00fcchslin</a> (ZHAW, School of Engineering, Applied Complex Systems Science), <a href=\"https://www.psychology.uzh.ch/en/areas/dev/geronto/team/mmartin.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Prof. Dr. Mike Martin</a> (UZH, Gerontopsychology), <a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/ottt/\" target=\"_blank\">Prof. Dr. Thomas Ott</a> (ZHAW, ZHAW School of Life Sciences and Facility Management, Computational Life Sciences). <a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/klam/\" target=\"_blank\">Prof. Dr. Verena Klamroth-Marganska</a> (ZHAW, School of Health, Occupational Therapy), was also invited as panelists but could not attend due to a last minute contingency.\u00a0 The panel was moderated by ZHAW\u2019s <a href=\"https://rchavarriaga.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Dr. Ricardo Chavarriaga</a>, head of the CLAIRE office Switzerland.</p>", "<p>The panel covered multiple topics, starting from the fundamental question of what is intelligence. Besides the ability of generalisation mentioned above, panelists mentioned the capacity defining (self-generated) goals as one of the main signs of intelligent. This is complemented by common-sense -achieving semantic meaning of things-and intentionality (that goes beyond simple activities and behaviours) which were all considered as particular characteristics of intelligence that AI has not yet fully achieved.</p>", "<p>Another important feature that was mentioned is the ability to establish connections between concrete scenes and these abstract goals, which enable e.g. intentionality. Additionally, the possibility of taking a very complex idea and transform it into a concrete stimulus (e.g. a picture) is an important element for intelligence. This process can be interpreted as inverse problem to processes characterised in the opening lecture. last but not least, it was mentioned that the fact that intelligence develops within a cultural environment should not be neglected.</p>", "<p>While addressing which directions AI development should go, the discussion ensued addressing the need for having system that learns while embedded and interacting in an environment, as well as the need of asking the question of what would we like to use the AI for; e.g., Some applications may not require human-like intelligence to be efficiently solved, while others we may prefer to be solved by humans instead of machines. Interestingly, it was pointed out that increase in computing power may be hindering our possibility of creating artificial intelligence as we lose capacity to learn from small datasets.</p>", "<p>Interaction between panelists and audience delve into different aspects of learning and the role of collective intelligence in the advancement of this field. As well, as the possibility of identifying universal learning rules that, combined with specialised brain-like structures and architectures, can lead us closer to understanding intelligence and more powerful AI. We will continue exploring these topics in future panels in this series and in the <a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/cai/colloquium/\" target=\"_blank\">CAI Colloquium</a>.</p>"]},

All these areas utilize deep learning, a methodology that optimizes complex machine learning systems with enormous compute power and many examples in the form of large data sets. For these computationally intensive optimization problems, graphics processing units (GPUs) are typically used because they can process many calculations in parallel. In addition to GPUs, CPUs are needed to load the data from the file system, as well as memory (RAM) to temporarily store the large amounts of data on the system.</p>", "<p>For this purpose, the CAI, together with the <a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/init/\" target=\"_blank\">InIT</a>, maintains a state-of-the-art infrastructure that is constantly being renewed and optimized. Currently, staff researchers have access to several systems with a total of 124 GPUs, 2648 CPU cores and 21.5 TB of RAM. After a massive increase in compute power in recent years, the storage system has now been renewed. This improves the management of deep learning training data sets that typically consist of millions of tiny files such as text snippets, images or short video sequences. To this end, a new storage system from <a href=\"https://www.dalco.ch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">DALCO</a> that offers 216 TB HDD and 15 TB SSD storage replaces the existing system. The new storage server is connected to the compute cluster with two redundant 100 GB network connections and thus allows lightning-fast data access.</p>", "<p>With this new storage server, the CAI is equipped to train deep learning models even more efficiently and thus accelerates research and industrial applications.</p>", "<p>\u00a0</p>", "<p>\u00a0</p>"]},
